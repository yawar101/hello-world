# hello-world
This is my first repository and i am creating it with the help of GitHub guide.
Well what should i write, I am have learned right now that the saved changes on github are called committs here accompanied by a committ message which explains why a particular change was made and saved so that the people who contribute later to your project can understand what you have done and why?
